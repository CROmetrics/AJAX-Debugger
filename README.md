AJAX Debugger will log all AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) activity to Chrome's Developer Tools Console. This allows developers to easily see top-level request info, like the HTTP status, response time, and size. Click the URL to open the AJAX call in a new tab, including all the inputs, making debugging much easier. You can even drill down to see all the low-level request details including the HTTP header information.

Logged data includes:
* File called  
* Response Status  
* Response Time  
* Response Size  
* AJAX source link with all input params  
* Object containing all request and response details  
* Response content (optional)  
* Warning if response takes longer than set time
